                "<h2>About Smart Cities</h2><p > Smart city has emerged as a buzzword in India ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined his vision for creating a hundred Smart cities. And, aside from the hype around the term Smart cities it does raise some pertinent questions such as what does it really mean to be a smart city? and why should Indians care about the smartness of their city? Indian cities are unique in that they confront the challenges of not only the 20th and 21st centuries but also some remnants from the 19th century. While cities like Bengaluru are participants in global innovation and increasingly compete with Silicon Valley to further enhance innovation, they also need to tackle important issues such as providing basic sanitation, public transport, clean water and effective waste management. So, the traditional approach of managing and maintaining our cities must change - both in mindset and in the way we administer them.</p> <h2>Call for City Innovations</h2> <p> There is tremendous potential in India to build an effective ecosystem to enable our burgeoning urban areas to become smart by using digital technology. This in turn will create employment opportunities and contribute to economic growth through innovation. Our cities are fast becoming the defining units of human habitation. How smartly we build, manage and operate our cities will be the single biggest determinant of our people's future. We owe it to our future generations to make our cities smart through the use of technology. <br>We request all the Public and Private bodies to join hands and show their mettle by coming up with smart, sustainable and long-term solutions. Applicants will be invited to present and showcase their technology during the National Techno-Management Fest of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, ATMOS 2015(October 8-12, 2015). <b>There is no fee to submit your innovation.</b> </p> <h2>Innovation Areas </h2> <p></p><ul><li> Power Generation</li><li>Grid &amp; Power Management </li><li>Cyber &amp; Grid Security </li><li>Energy Storage </li><li>Transportation Solutions </li><li>Sensors &amp; Communications </li><li>Environmental Solutions</li><li> Water Management </li><li>Waste Management </li><li> Buildings &amp; Efficiency </li><li>Facility Management </li><li> Metering &amp; Metrics </li><li>Data Analysis/Management </li><li> Services/Solution Providers </li></ul> <p></p> <h2>Contact Details:</h2> <p> Hryidesh Tewani: +91-9000755319</p>",

When these threats exceed human coping capabilities or the absorptive capacities of environmental systems they give rise to industrial disasters. </br>Industrial hazards can occur at any stage in the production process, including extraction, processing, manufacture, transportation, storage, use, and disposal. Losses generally involve the release of damaging substances or damaging levels of energy from industrial facilities or sophisticated equipment's into surrounding environments. This usually occurs in the form of explosions, fires, spills, leaks, or wastes. Releases may occur because of factors that are internal to the industrial system (e.g. engineering flaws) or they may occur because of external factors (e.g. extremes of nature).</br>Consider yourself intelligent?

                "<h2>Overview</h2> <p>I bet most of us have dreamt of racing our cars at top speeds through spick, black race courses. Come October and BITS-Pilani,Hyderabad Campus will be all set to fulfil your dream,well,in a way.On the line of the ecstatic Moto GP competition,we are conducting The Mini GP competition.The competition will have its participants (or racers) drive self-designed remote controlled cars through deliciously twisty race tracks to win the final cup! Seems simple?Well, brace yourselves for some rock solid competition. Forget not, the more innovative and inventive your design is, the closer you are to the Mini GP cup.Fasten your seatbelts and let the adrenaline pump up!</p> <h2>Problem Statement</h2> <p>The participants are expected to race their remote control based IC engine cars through tracks whose complexity is bound to increase level after level.The teams completing the laps in the best possible time will qualify for a grand final race.The design skills and application of real-world driving skills to the miniature cars are put to test. </p> <h2>Competition Rules </h2> <p></p><ul><li>    The track will have check points at regular intervals.</li> <li>    In case a machine tumbles, or halts, or goes off the arena at any point on the track, only one of the participants is allowed to lift it up and place it at the nearest checkpoint behind that point. (Previous two rules are for non-racing rounds. The rules for racing round will be told on the spot)</li> <li>Until and unless there is a need to touch the vehicle as stated above, they have to be fully remot3e controlled throughout the rave.</li> <li>Every time the machine requires lifting by the team member, a time-penalty will be imposed.</li> <li>Any vehicle is not allowed to leave any disintegrated part on the race track amidst of the race. In case this happens, the team will be disqualified.</li> <li>The teams are also not allowed to damage the opponents vehicle deliberately. If found guilty, the accused team will be disqualified.</li> <li>There will be a time-penalty for reverse gearing.</li> <li>Teams may consist of a maximum of 5 members.</li> </ul> <p></p> <h2>Judging Criteria</h2> <p></p><ul><li>Participants are expected to design their own racing car. However, in case the participants use readymade cars, they will only be evaluated for 3/4th of the total marks. That is a penalty if 1/4th of the total marks will be levied on them. If their car is part self-designed and part readymade, then the marks will be given accordingly as per the judge's discretion. Above mentioned penalty is not applicable for the final round. </li><li>Driving ability and application skills of the participant will also be put to test. </li> <li>Lap time will be another criterion to decide the winner. </li></ul><p></p> <h2>Vehicle Specifications</h2> <p></p><ul><li>The vehicle should be designed so that it fits in an 800mm X 700 mm box at every given point of time in the race. This is excluding the remote controller.</li> <li>It is essential that the car be designed with an internal combustion engine (IC engine). Motors etc. should not be the main driving sources of the car. However, for steering mechanisms or any other mechanism apart from propulsion DC motors and servos can be used. </li> <li>Only one IC engine should be used in the vehicle. Use of any other sources such as chemicals, compressed gas, rockets etc. for propulsion is not allowed. The allowed capacity of IC engine to be used is 4.5 cc or less. </li> <li>The vehicle has to be necessarily controlled by a wireless remote control system throughout the competition. The vehicle must have two remote controllers of different frequencies or an alternate frequency remote control circuit which can be switched to either frequency before the start of the game. This is done to avoid frequency interference between the two competing vehicles. </li> <li>Remote control systems from toys or the ones purchased from a market might be used without any fear of penalization. </li> <li>The vehicle parts can be ready made. But there will be extra points if you make chassis and steering mechanism by yourself (See judging criteria for more detail).If you are making your car then other functional parts like motors and servos, gears, springs, engine, remote control systems, batteries, wheels, braking mechanism are allowed to be used as directly available from the market. </li> <li>It is essential that the vehicle has an onboard power supply to provide electricity to any mechanism requiring electric power. </li><li>Electric voltage not more than 12V should be used in the machine wherever required. </li><li>Participants are advised to use a proper cooling mechanism to prevent overheating of the engine. </li> <li>Verify with the organizers if you have the slightest doubt whether a component can be used or not. Please do not hesitate. Designs not complying with the vehicle specifications will be disqualified. </li></ul><p></p> <h2>General Rules</h2> <p></p><ul> <li>Depending on the number of teams participating and other time constraints, the arena will be given to the participants for practicing. </li><li>The time slots will be given on the basis of first come first serve basis, but little duration for practicing is assured to everyone. </li><li>Each team must come up with its own, unique team name. </li><li>Organizers reserve the right to change any of the above rules. </li><li>articipants can address their queries indirectly via e-mail or forums and directly by calling up the organizers. </li><li>For help and reference, some material will be uploaded soon. </li><li>Organizers and judges decision shall be considered as final and binding on all. </li></ul><p></p> <h2>Eligibility</h2> <p>Each participant must be a full time student enrolled in an undergraduate or post graduate program from any recognized university or college. Any professional body other than student are not allowed in this competition. </p> <h2>Registration</h2> <p></p><ul>Participants have to submit an abstract giving the complete description of their vehicles based on the following lines. <li>Teams that fabricate their own vehicle must explain the steering mechanism and the chassis layout in detail, along with proper illustrations. Picture(s) showing all the three should be attached.</li> <li>The participants are required to send the photographs of the chassis before assembly so as to ensure that the parts of the car have been built by themselves, that being the case.</li> <li>Photograph of the car in the current state must also be sent with the name of the photograph as the date on which it is taken.</li> <li>Specification of all other components like the engine, remote controllers etc must be specified.</li> <li>The complete abstract along with the photos and the team name and members name.</li> <li>If readymade cars are used by the team then the team should mail the exact specification of the car.</li> <li>Write the name of team along with the name of team leader and team members with contact numbers and e-mail ids.&nbsp;{put contact details here and the email to which they have to send their design illustrations}</li> <li>A confirmation mail will be sent to the Team leaders.</li></ul> <p></p> <h4>Contact:</h4> <p>Mithilesh: +91-8466095758</p>",

On their way they have to take multiple decisions, each of which influences their profitability. The teams have to start with the funding which they invest in multiple areas such as hiring, land and licenses, R&D and marketing. The event has been a success ever since its inception and saw upwards of 60 participants last year. It is a challenge designed to make people think on their feet, to make them responsible for their way of thought and reward them just the same. The success of this event lies in the core essence that markets- in all sectors- are in fact dynamic.  The change in the market in SuitUp is represented by the algorithm used to calculate the company’s holdings at the end of every step that gets them closer to the end. The algorithm used to define the profit one receives has to have multiple check points to ensure the competition reflects the real world the best it can. The fact that human interaction is necessary in the form of bribing the city officials to get their desired licenses is an interesting feature of this event which makes it that more interesting. </p>",

Participants get to work on 4 different engines, 2-stroke, 4 stroke, petrol car, and diesel car engines. The participants get a valuable experience of opening the engine inside out, observing the parts and functions that keep the engine functioning. To ensure everyone grasps the working, an R&D expert will be present at all times to guide students and quench their curiosity. At the end of the two day workshop, a certificate and an internship certificate are provided to the students.
